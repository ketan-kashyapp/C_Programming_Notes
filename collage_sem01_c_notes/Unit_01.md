# Unit 1: Introduction to Components of a Computer System and Programming Basics 

## ✅ Components of a Computer System

1️⃣ **Memory**

* Stores data and instructions temporarily or permanently.
* Types: RAM (temporary), ROM (permanent), Cache.

2️⃣ **Processor (CPU)**

* Executes instructions and processes data.
* Components: ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), CU (Control Unit), Registers.

3️⃣ **Input/Output Devices (I/O Devices)**

* Input: Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner.
* Output: Monitor, Printer.

4️⃣ **Storage**

* Permanent data storage: Hard Disk, SSD, Optical Discs.

5️⃣ **Operating System (OS)**

* Manages hardware and software resources.
* Provides interface between user and computer.

6️⃣ **Assembler, Compiler, Interpreter, Loader, Linker**

* **Assembler:** Converts assembly language to machine code.
* **Compiler:** Translates high-level code to machine code before execution.
* **Interpreter:** Executes code line by line.
* **Loader:** Loads compiled code into memory for execution.
* **Linker:** Combines object files into a single executable.

## ✅ Idea of Algorithm

* **Algorithm:** Step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.

### Representation of Algorithm

1️⃣ Flowchart: Diagrammatic representation of steps.
2️⃣ Pseudo Code: Structured text-based representation.

**Example:**

* Problem: Find sum of two numbers.

**Pseudo Code:**

```
Start
Read A, B
Sum = A + B
Print Sum
End
```

**Flowchart:**

* Start → Input A, B → Compute Sum → Output Sum → End

### From Algorithms to Programs

* Algorithm is converted into source code using programming language.
* Source code → Compiler/Interpreter → Object Code → Executable Code

## ✅ Programming Basics in C

### Structure of C Program

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    // statements
    return 0;
}
```

### Writing and Executing the First C Program

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

* **Compilation Errors:** Syntax mistakes detected during compilation.
* **Logical Errors:** Program runs but gives incorrect output.
* **Object Code:** Machine code generated by compiler.
* **Executable Code:** Code that can be executed by the OS.

## ✅ Components of C Language

* Keywords, Identifiers, Constants, Variables, Operators, Functions.

## ✅ Standard I/O in C

* `printf()` for output, `scanf()` for input.

## ✅ Fundamental Data Types

* `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`.

## ✅ Variables and Memory Locations

* Variables store data in memory locations.
* Example:

```c
int a; // variable a stored in memory
```

## ✅ Storage Classes

* **auto, register, static, extern** determine variable lifetime and scope.
